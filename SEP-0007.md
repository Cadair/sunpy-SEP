# Abstract
This SEP specifies the formal relationship between the SunPy project and
software packages affiliated with the SunPy project, but not directly managed
by it. These "Afilliated Packages" shall be able to register with the SunPy
Project to benefit from the publicity and support available within the SunPy
community, while maintaining their independence and control over the package.
It is allowed, but not required or expected, that an affiliate package could be
merged into the core SunPy library, following the normal procedures, once it
has matured.


# Detailed Description
As a community driven project SunPy encourages contributions from a diverse
group of people on a wide range of software. Not all solar physics software
falls within the remit of the core SunPy library, and some software developers
may wish to maintain a degree of control over their software than it being part
of the core library would afford them.
Both of these reasons provide motivation for software which is associated with
SunPy but not contained within the core library. Having an association with
SunPy will provide advantages to these packages, such as the knowledge of the
SunPy community and the publicity provided by SunPy, while also allowing the
whole SunPy ecosystem to grow and provide useful tools to a larger audience.

## Requirements for Affiliated Packages

The SunPy project therefore maintains a list of official "Affiliated Packages",
which is a software package that has registered with the SunPy board and been
accepted as an affiliated package. There are certain requirements for a package
to qualify as an affiliated package:

* The package must make use of all appropriate features in the core SunPy
library, to reduce code duplication and complexity.
* The software must provide documentation that explains the function and use of
the package, and this documentation should be of comparable standard to the
core SunPy library.
* The code should as far as possible provide an easy to run test suite to
verify the correct operation of the package.
* The developers of an affiliated package should engage with the rest of the
SunPy community to encourage knowledge and code sharing within the community.


## Types of Affiliated Packages

There are two primary types of affiliated packages: associated and external.
Associated packages are packages that are developed under the purview of the
SunPy board, but with a different maintainer than the core library. These
packages are expected to be either large features in development with the long
term goal of being included in the core library or features that are outside
the scope of the core library. These packages will normally have a GitHub
repository under the SunPy GitHub organization. Anyone is able to develop an
affiliated package of this type at the discretion of the SunPy board or
executive director.
External affiliated packages are packages developed independently of the SunPy
project but which have fulfilled the requirements above and have been accepted 
as an official affiliated package.
There is no reason why an external affiliated package can not become an
associated affiliated package or vice-a-versa.
There is also no technical difference between the two types of packages, they
are both "equal citizens" of the SunPy project, the difference is purely an
organizational one.

There is also the provision for the SunPy board to accept an affiliated package
provisionally, this applies when the package currently does not fulfill the
requirements laid out above, but is working towards compliance with them.

## Registering an Affiliated Package

To register an affiliated package contact the chair of the SunPy board, or
another board member, who will propose your package to the board who will then
make a decision on your package. Contact details for the board are available on
the main website.

## List of Official Affiliated Packages

A list of the official affiliated packages will be kept in the SunPy Wiki. This
list shall contain links to the source code, any website associated with the
package and contact details of the maintainer of the package.
There will also be a list of packages maintained on the www.sunpy.org website,
which shall provide information to users about the affiliated packages.

## Packaging Affiliated Packages

To make it easier for developers to maintain affiliated packages a package
template will be provided. This will allow package maintainers to not have to
worry about Python packaging and documentation / testing infrastructure, and
concentrate on the development of their package.
This template will provide a package which is laid out and behaves much like
the core SunPy library.


# Decision Rational
This is a great idea because...
