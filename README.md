# SEPs: SunPy Proposal for Enhancement

# What is a SEP?
SEP stands for SunPy Enhancement Proposal. A SEP is a design document modeled
after the Python Enhancement Proposal which describes a new SunPy feature,
process, or major changes to existing processes or features. *Anyone* can
submit a SEP by making a pull request to this repository. You can find the
official definition of SEPs in [SEP-0001](./SEP-0001.md).
The full list of SEPs can be found in [SEP-0000](./SEP-0000.md).

# Process
Discussion is expected to take place using existing mechanisms and eventually
a decision is made regarding whether the proposal should be accepted or rejected
by a vote by the SunPy Board.
