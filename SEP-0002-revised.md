# SEP-0002 - SunPy Organization Definition

# Rationale

This SEP describes the second major iteration of the governance for the SunPy Project.
The objectives of the rewrite were to adapt the governance for the changes the project has seen since the first iteration of this document was written in 2014.
This rewrite aims to detail a governance structure, which strives to be lightweight, while being designed to enable the project to grow, and facilitating more input from the wider SunPy community.

# The SunPy Project

The primary mission of the SunPy Project is *To develop and facilitate a high-quality, easy-to-use, community-led, free and open-source solar data analysis ecosystem based on the scientific Python environment*.
This includes but is not limited to the following tasks:

* developing the sunpy core library and other affiliated packages
* supporting a community of affiliated packages
* managing and protect the SunPy brand and identity
* promoting SunPy to the community
* managing SunPy assets, i.e. GitHub organization, domain name etc.

# Governance Structure

The SunPy Project's governance involves the following five components:

* The Community
* The Project Members
* The Steering Committee
* The Advisory Board
* The Ombudsperson

The SunPy project exists for the benefit of the whole Community: users, developers, and members of the wider solar physics and scientific software community.
The Community is the ultimate authority in how the project is managed.
This authority is exercised through the processes outlined in this document, primarily through the Steering Committee and the Project Members.
Whenever possible, decisions shall be approved by consensus, considering input from the entire community, rather than taken unilaterally by Project Members or the Steering Committee.

## Advisory Board
The primary functions of the Advisory Board are:

* to advise the Steering Committee on management of the project,
* aid in finding funding for the project to ensure the core aims of the project can be met,
* nominate a Ombudsperson,
* ensure that the governance of the project is running as intended.

The Advisory Board is self-electing, with members appointed by a vote of the existing Advisory Board.

* **Membership**: The Advisory Board shall consist of at least 3 members and no more than 5 members.
The Advisory Board selects how many members are needed.
All members shall serve a maximum of a two-year term, however a term may be extended until a successor has been appointed.
A member may be re-appointed at the end of their term.
Membership terms should be staggered so that approximately half the number of members will end their terms in any given year.
The Advisory Board may fill vacancies or may appoint new members to fill a previously unfilled Advisory Board position, subject to the maximum number of members.
The Advisory Board should work to ensure that the composition of the Advisory Board represents a diverse cross-section of the scientific community with an interest in SunPy.
This diversity should consider things such as research topic, career stage, as well as all other forms of diversity such as gender.
A Advisory Board member may be removed by a two-thirds majority vote of the Advisory Board or Project Members.

* **Meetings**:  The Advisory Board shall meet with the Steering Committee at least every quarter at times and places fixed by the Advisory Board.
Advisory Board meetings shall provide at least one week (7 days) notice.
Notice of meetings shall provide the information necessary to participate in the meeting.
Minutes for the meetings shall be recorded and made public as much as is appropriate.

The Advisory Board shall organize itself as it sees fit.

* **Advise and Consent**: The Steering Committee shall present the state of the project and future plans at meetings of the Advisory Board on a yearly basis.
The Advisory Board shall advise and consent on those plans.

* **Forcing a Project Vote**: In the unlikely event that the Advisory Board does not agree with a decision made by the Steering Committee, it can force Project Members to consent to the decision through a majority vote.

## The Steering Committee
The role of the Steering Committee, which is chaired by the Lead Developer, is to lead the day-to-day operations of the project.
The Steering Committee shall be responsible for the running of the project under advisement of the Advisory Board.
This includes:

* holding regular meetings with the developer community (at least monthly)
* making regular reports to the Advisory Board (at least quarterly)
* having ownership privileges to the SunPy GitHub organization and other community assets
* creating, maintaining and enforcing the SunPy code of conduct (see below)
* accepting or rejecting SEPs based on community consensus (excluding this SEP, see below)
* delegating responsibility and authority to other community roles
* planning and managing finances and financial processes of the project.

### Composition

The Steering Committee is formed of three members of the SunPy community with equal status on the committee, and they do not need to be Project Members.
The members of the committee are elected into three roles to help with distributing the work load, these three roles are:

* **The lead developer** chairs the Steering Committee and is responsible for holding regular (at least monthly) meetings, and ensuring that the committee is represented at all Advisory Board meetings.
* **The deputy lead developer** in the absence of the lead developer, the deputy shall perform all the duties of the lead developer.
* **The financial officer** the financial officer is primarily responsible for ensuring the health of the project finances and setting up processes for managing expenses and reporting to the Advisory Board on financial matters.

The Steering Committee is elected by the **Project Members**.

### Decision Making

The Steering Committee should strive to make decisions by consensus.
Where possible and appropriate, consensus should be reached between the members of the committee, and that consensus should reflect the consensus of the whole SunPy community.
If consensus can not be reached between the committee members, decisions can be taken by a majority vote.

### Electing the Steering Committee

An election to fill a vacant role on the Steering Committee will occur in two stages:

* Nominations: No less than three weeks before an election a public announcement of the election must be made and nominations solicited for no less than two weeks.
Candidates who have accepted their nomination (self nominations are allowed) should write a short statement supporting their candidacy, which will be made public as soon as possible, but no later than before the election starts.
* Election: All candidates that have written statement will be put to a vote of the Project Members and the candidate with the most votes shall be elected to the position.
In the event that more than one position has to be filled simultaneously each position shall be filled as if it were an independent election.

### Term

Each position on the Steering Committee has a term of three years, from the date of the announcement of the election results.

If there is a vacancy part way through a term, then a by-election will be held where the candidate elected to the committee will serve the remainder of the term of the member they are replacing.

For the first election of the coordinating committee, one member will have a one year term, one member a two year term and one member a three year term.
The term length of the elected candidates may be decided between themselves, in the case agreement can not be reached the person elected to the financial officer role will serve three years, the deputy lead developer two years and the lead developer one year.

### Removing Steering Committee Members

In exceptional circumstances, the Project Members may remove one or more sitting Steering Committee members via a single vote.

Such a vote is triggered when a Project Member calls for one publicly on an appropriate Project-wide communication channel, and two other active Project Members second the proposal.

For Steering Committee Member(s) to be removed, two-thirds of the active Project Members (where the count includes the member being voted on if they are a Project Member) must vote in support of the removal.

To avoid repeated removal votes, any individual Project Member who has called for, or seconded such a vote, may not call for or second a vote to remove any Steering Committee member for one year from the original motion.

## The Project Members

The Project Members are trusted community members with a proven track record of constructive contribution to the goals of the project.
Collectively, the Project Members make decisions about the direction of the project and have authority over the project, which is delegated to the Steering Committee.

It is expected that Project Members act as role models for the Community and are custodians of the SunPy Project.
The Project Members elect a Steering Committee to lead the SunPy Project.

### Responsibilities and Rights

Project Members may and should participate in formal votes on:

* Adding new Project Members
* Electing Steering Committee members
* Appointing the Ombudsperson
* Removing Project Members
* Removing Steering Committee members
* Removing the Ombudsperson
* Approving changes to this SEP via a vote (see below)
* Other matters where the Steering Committee or the Advisory Board believes a vote is appropriate.

### Membership

Project Members of the SunPy Project must demonstrate all of the following:

* A good grasp of the philosophy of the SunPy Project
* A solid track record of being constructive and helpful
* Significant contributions to the Project's goals, in any form
* A willingness to dedicate time to improving the Project
* A willingness to recruit, train, and nominate new team members

Project Membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts that align well with the philosophy and the goals of the SunPy Project.

### Initial Membership

To be able to elect new Project Members an initial set of Project Members are needed.
People meeting the following criteria will be invited to form the initial group of Project Members.
They should consider the above responsiblities and actively agree to taking them on if they choose to accept the invitation.

* Current commit access to the core repo, or any accepted affiliated package maintained by the project, and with a commit to that repository within the last 12 months.
* Currently holds a role listed under the community roles section of the website: https://sunpy.org/project/#community-roles.
* Is a currently serving Advisory Board member.

### Adding New Project Members

Anyone is eligible to be nominated to be a Project member, as long as they meet the criteria laid out in the Membership section above.
Self-nominations are encouraged.

The process for adding a new Project member is as follows:

1. A nomination is received by the Steering Committee, a nomination should include a short, factual, statement stating how the nominee meets the criteria for Project Membership.
The Steering Committee, and the Ombudsperson check that the nomination is factually accurate and their record of contribution to the community adheres to the Code of Conduct.
1. The candidate is then put to the Project Members.
The name and nomination statement of the candidate will be shared with the Project Members.
The candidate can become a Project Member if, during the two weeks following the candidate being put to the Project Members, five existing Project members approve the candidate and no Project Members call for an election.
1. Project Members can call for an election either by informing the Steering Committee or the Ombudsperson.
If a vote is called for then the candidate will be come a Project Member with a simple majority of all votes cast in the election.
An election needs to be announced to the Project Members one week before the voting opens and voting will be open for two weeks.
1. The candidate will be informed promptly of the outcome by the Steering Committee.

The name of a candidate should not be shared outside of the Project Members until they become a Project Member.
A public list of Project Members will be kept on the SunPy website.

Nominations, approvals and any elections of Project Members should take place before the initial election of the Steering Committee.

### Active and Emeritus Status

Project Members have no term limits.
Project Members who are no longer actively contributing to the project should contact the Steering Committee to move themselves to emeritus status.
Active Project Members who have not made any significant contributions for two years, will be contacted by the Steering Committee and be asked to move themselves to emeritus status.
The Steering Committee can change a Project Member's status to emeritus.
Emeritus Project Members will continue to be listed on the website.
Emeritus Project Members are not able to participate in votes.
An emeritus member may declare themselves to be active again at any time if they feel they are making contributions.

### Removing Project Members

In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the Project Members against their will.
A vote of the Project Members must be held to remove a Project Member.
Such a vote is triggered by a motion (sent to the Steering Committee and the Ombudsperson) made by an active Project Member, which must be seconded by an additional Project Member.
The vote must conclude no more than three months after the motion is seconded.
Removal requires approval by two-thirds of all active Project Members at the time the motion is made.
The motion, second, and vote will be by secret ballot.
Removal under this provision will be reflected by updating the list of Project Members.
A member removed via this mechanism does not have emeritus status.

It may be necessary for the Ombudsperson and the Steering Committee to remove a Project Member for violations of the Code of Conduct.
In this case, the Steering Committee, Ombudsperson and Advisory Board will work together to make this decision.

# Ombudsperson

The Ombudsperson represents the interests of the Community by providing an alternative point of contact for sensitive issues such as code of conduct violations and ethical concerns.
Candidates for this project role are publicly nominated by the Advisory Board, after which at least two weeks for comment is allowed, and then the nominee must be confirmed by two-thirds of the active Project Members.

The Ombudsperson has no term limit but can resign at any time, or be removed by the same process as removing a Project Member.
In the period between removal/resignation and new appointment, the Steering Comittee will temporarily take over the responsibilities of the Ombudsperson, should the need arise.

# Future changes to the governance (Revision of SEP-2)

Due to the fundamental nature of this SEP, it would be inappropriate for the Steering Committee alone to have authority to approve modifications to it.
Therefore, if this document is to be modified in any way, then those modifications shall be put to a vote of the Project Members.
This vote shall require a 2/3s majority of those voting to approve the changes.

# Code of Conduct

The SunPy organization shall have an explicit code of conduct to state the norms of peer interactions, including inclusiveness and respect, and describe the process for dispute resolution.
The code of conduct shall be publicly posted on the SunPy website.
The code of conduct shall be accessible in such a manner as to welcome and incorporate feedback from the developer community, even anonymous feedback.

# Implementation of this Revision of SEP 2

This change to SEP 2 will be implemented in the following stages:

1. The list of initial Project Members will be drawn up and added to the SunPy website.
2. A communication channel private to the Project Members will be created where discussions and announcements of votes can take place.
3. A Ombudsperson will be nominated by the Advisory Board and confirmed by the initial group of Project Members.
4. Nomination of new Project Members will be solicited and confirmed by the initial Project Members.
5. The process for electing the initial Steering Committee will be followed as laid out above.

# Attribution

This document builds on the original version of SEP 2.
The Project Members section, in particular, is heavily inspired by Voting Members in the Astropy project's [APE 0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst), but other sections also copy from it.
