# SEP-0002 - SunPy Organization Definition

# Abstract
The SunPy project has changed significantly since the first version of SEP-0002 was written in 2014.
This SEP details a new governance structure designed to enable the project to grow, while allowing for more input from the wider SunPy community.

## Detailed Description
The primary role of the SunPy Project is to *facilitate and promote the use and development of community-led, free and open-source solar data-analysis software based on the scientific Python environment*.
This includes but is not limited to the following tasks:

* developing the SunPy software library
* manage and protect the SunPy brand and identity
* promote SunPy to the community
* managing SunPy assets, i.e. github account, domain name etc.

# Governance Structure

The SunPy project's governance involves the following five components:

* The SunPy Community
* The Project Members
* The Steering Committee
* The Advisory Board
* The Ombusperson

The SunPy project is ultimately run by the whole community: users, developers, and members of the wider solar physics and scientific software communtiy, for the benifit of all.
This document descibes how the project is run through delegation of this authority, primarily to the Steering Committee and the Project Members.
Wherever possible all descisions taken should be done by consensus, considering input from both active contributors and the wider community.

## Advisory Board
The primary functions of the advisory board are: to advise the steering committee on management of the project, find funding for the project to ensure the core aims of the project can be met, nominate a Ombudsperson, and to ensure that the governance of the project is running as intended.

* **Membership Limit**: The board shall consist of at least 5 members and no more than 10 members.
Within these limits, the board may increase or decrease the number of people serving on the board, including for the purpose of staggering the terms of members.

* **Term Length**: All members shall be elected to serve a maximum of a two-year term, however the term may be extended until a successor has been elected. 
A member may be re-elected at the end of their term.

* **Staggering**: Members terms shall be staggered so that approximately half the number of members will end their terms in any given year.
The term of office shall be considered to begin January 1 and end December 31 of the second year in office, unless the term is extended until such time as a successor has been elected.

* **Vacancies**: The board may fill vacancies or may appoint new members to fill a previously unfilled board position, subject to the maximum number of members.
The board shall fill vacancies as soon as possible.
The board should work to ensure that the composition of the board represents a diverse cross-section of the solar physics community.
This diversity should consider things such as research topic, career stage, as well as all other forms of diversity such as gender.

* **Removal**: A board member may be removed by a two-thirds majority vote of the full board, if (a) the member is absent and unexcused from 50% or more meetings of the board in a twelve month period.
The board chair is empowered to excuse members from attendance for a reason deemed adequate by the board chair.
The chair shall not have the power to excuse him/herself from the board meeting attendance and in that case, the board vice chair shall excuse the chair.
Or (b) for cause or no cause, if before any meeting of the board at which a vote on removal will be made the director in question is given electronic or written notification of the boardâ€™s intention to discuss her/his case and is given the opportunity to be heard at a meeting of the board.
The board can remove the executive director by a two-thirds majority vote of the full board for cause or no cause.

* **Meetings**:  The board shall have at least a meeting every quarter at times and places fixed by the board.
Board meetings shall provide at least one week (7) days notice.
Notice of meetings shall specify the place, day, and hour of meeting.
The purpose of the meeting need not be specified.

* **Board officers**: The officers of the board shall be a board chair, vice-chair, and secretary, all of whom shall be chosen by, and serve at the pleasure of, the board.
Officers shall serve one year terms and can serve consecutive terms.

* **Board Chair**: The board chair shall lead the board in performing its duties and responsibilities, including, if present, leading all meetings of the board, and shall perform all other duties incident to the office or properly required by the board.

* **Vice-chair**: In the absence of the board chair, the vice-chair shall perform the duties of the board chair.
When so acting, the vice-chair shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the board chair.

* **Secretary**: The secretary shall be responsible for keeping the minutes of all meetings and actions of the board.
The minutes of each meeting shall state the time and place that it was held, the members present, and such other information as shall be necessary to determine the actions taken and whether the meeting was held in accordance with the law and these Bylaws.

* **Advise and Consent**: The steering committee shall present the state of the project and future plans at meetings of the board.
The advisory board shall advise and consent on those plans.

## The Steering Committee
The role of the steering committee which is headed by the Lead Developer, is to manage the day to day operations of the SunPy organization.
The steering committee shall be responsible for the running of the project under advisement of the board.
This includes:

* holding regular meetings with the developer community (at least monthly)
* making regular reports to the board (at least quarterly)
* having ownership privileges to the SunPy GitHub organization
* creating, maintaining and enforcing the SunPy code of conduct (see below)
* accepting or rejecting SEPs based on community consensus
* delegating responsibility and authority to other community roles
* planing and manage finances and financial processes of the project.

### Composition

The steering committee is formed of three roles:

* **The lead developer** chairs the steering committee and is responsible for holding regular (at least monthly) meetings, and ensuring that the committee is represented at all board meetings.
* **The deputy lead developer** in the absense of the lead developer, the deputy shall perform all the duties of the lead developer.
* **The financial officier** the financial officer is primarily responsible for ensuring the health of the project financies and setting up processes for managing expenses and reporting to the board on financial matters.

The steering committee is elected by the **project members**.

### Decision Making

The steering committee should strive to make decisions by consensus.
If consensus can not be reached decisions can be taken by a majority vote.

### Electing the Steering Committee

An election to fill a vacant role on the steering committee will occurr in two stages:

* Nominations: No less than three weeks before an election a public annoucement of the election must be made and nominations solicited for no less than two weeks.
Candidates which have accepted their nomination (self nominations are allowed) should write a short statement which will be made public as soon as possible, but no later than before the election starts.
* Election: All candidates that have written a short statement will be put to a vote of the project members and the candidate with the most votes shall be elected to the position.
In the event that more than one position has to be filled simultaneously each election shall be treated as a separate election for the purposes of this process.

### Term

Each position on the steering committee has a term of three years, from the date of the announcement of the election results.

If there is a vacancy part way through a term, then a by-election will be held where the candidate elected to the committee will serve the remainder of the term of the member they are replacing.

For the first election of the coordinating committee, one member will have a one year term, one member a two year term and one member a three year term.
The term length of the elected candidates may be decided between themselves, in the case agreement can not be reached the person elected to the financial officer role will serve three years, the deputy lead developer two years and the lead developer one year.

### Removing Members

In exceptional circumstances, the project members may remove one or more sitting steering committee members via a single vote.

Such a vote is triggered when a project member calls for one publicly on an appropriate Project-wide communication channel, and two other active project members second the proposal.

For Steering Committee Member(s) to be removed, two-thirds of the active Project Members (where the count includes the member being voted on if they are a project member) must vote in support of the removal.

To avoid repeated removal votes, any individual Project Member who has called for, or seconded such a vote, may not call for or second a vote to remove any Steering Committee member for one year from the original motion.

## The Project Members

The project members are trusted community members with a proven track record of constructive contribution to the goals of the project.
Collectively, the project members make decisions about the direction of the project and have authority over the project, which is delegated to the Steering Committee.

Project Members are expected to act as role models for the community and custodians of the SunPy Project, on behalf of the community and all those who rely on SunPy.
They will act as representatives of the SunPy Project, where necessary, including in online discussions or at official SunPy events.

### Responsibilities and Rights

Project Members may and should participate in formal votes on:

* Adding new Project Members
* Electing Steering Committee members
* Appointment of the Ombudsperson
* Removing Project Members
* Removing Steering Committee members
* Removing the Ombudsperson
* Changes to this SEP
* Other matters for which the Steering Committee believes a vote is appropriate.

### Membership

Project Members of the SunPy Project must demonstrate all of the following:

* A good grasp of the philosophy of the SunPy Project
* A solid track record of being constructive and helpful
* Significant contributions to the Project's goals, in any form
* A willingness to dedicate time to improving the Project
* A willingness to recruit, train, and nominate new team members

Project Membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts that align well with the philosophy and the goals of the SunPy Project.

### Initial Membership

To be able to elect new Project Members an initial set of Project Members are needed.
People meeting the following criteria will be invited to form the initial group of Project Members.

* Current commit access to the core repo, or any accepted affiliated package maintained by the project, and with a commit to that repository within the last 12 months.
* Currently holds a role listed under the community roles section of the website: https://sunpy.org/project/#community-roles.
* Is a currently serving board member.

### Adding New Project Members

Anyone is eligible to be nominated to be a Project member, as long as they meet the criteria laid out in the Membership section above.
Self-nominations are encouraged.

The process for adding a new Project member is as follows:

1. A nomination is recieved by the steering committee.
The steering committee, and the ombudsperson check that the nomination is factually accurate and their record of contribution to the community adheres to the Code of Conduct.
1. The candidate is then put to the Project Members.
The name and nomination statement of the candidate will be shared with the Project Members.
The candidate can become a Project member if five existing Project members approve the candidate and no Project Members call for an election within two weeks of the candidate being put to the Project Members.
1. Project Members can call for an election either by posting in the discussion of the candidate or reaching out privetly to the Steering Committee or the Ombudsperson.
If a vote is called for then the candidate will be come a Project Member with a simple majority of all votes cast in the election.
An election needs to be annouced to the Project Members one week before the voting opens and voting will be open for two weeks.
1. The candidate will be informed prompty of the outcome by the Steering Committee.

The name of a candidate should not be shared outside of the Project Members until they become a Project Member.
A public list of Project Members will be kept on the SunPy website.

Nominations, discussions and any elections of Project Members should take place before the initial election of the Steering Committee.

### Active and Emeritus Status

Project Members have no term limits.
Project Members who are no longer actively contributing to the project should contact the Steering Committee to move themselves to emeritus status.
Active Project Members who have not made any significant contributions for two years, will be contacted by the Steering Committee and be asked to move themselves to emeritus status.
The Steering Committee can change a Project Member's status to emeritus.
Emeritus Project Members will continue to be listed on the website.
Emeritus Project Members are not able to participate in votes.
An emeritus member may request to be marked as active at any time if they feel they are making contributions.

## Removing Project Members

In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the Project Members against their will.
A vote must be held to remove a Project Member.
Such a vote is triggered by a motion made by an active Project Member, which must be seconded by an additional Project Member.
The vote must conclude no more than three months after the motion is seconded.
Removal requires approval by two-thirds of all active Project Members at the time the motion is made.
The motion, second, and vote will be by secret ballot.
Removal under this provision will be reflected by updating the list of Project Members.
A member removed via this mechanism does not have emeritus status.

It may be necessary for the Ombudsperson and the Steering Committee to remove a Project Member for violations of the Code of Conduct.
In this case, the Steering Committee, Ombudsperson and Board will work together to make this decision.

# Ombudsperson

The Ombudsperson represents the interests of the SunPy community by providing an alternative point of contact for sensitive issues such as code of conduct violations and ethical concerns.
Candidates for this project role are publicly nominated by the Board, after which at least two weeks for comment is allowed, and then the nominee must be confirmed by two-thirds of the active Project Members.

The Ombudsperson has no term limit but can resign at any time, or be removed by the same process as removing a Project Member.
In the period between removal/resignation and new appointment, the Steering Committee will temporarily take over the responsibilities of the Ombudsperson, should the need arise.

# Code of Conduct

The SunPy organization shall have an explicit code of conduct to state the norms of peer interactions, including inclusiveness and respect, and describe the process for dispute resolution.
The code of conduct shall be publicly posted on the SunPy website.
The code of conduct shall be accessible in such a manner as to welcome and incorporate feedback from the developer community, even anonymous feedback.

# Implementation of this Revision of SEP 2

This change to SEP 2 will be implemented in the following stages:

1. The list of initial Project Members will be drawn up and added to the SunPy website.
2. A communication channel private to the Project Members will be created where discussions and announcements of votes can take place.
3. A Ombudsperson will be nominated by The Board and confimed by the initial group of project members.
4. Nomination of new Project Members will be solicited and confirmed by the initial project members.
5. The process for electing the initial Steering Committee will be followed as laid out above.

# Attribution

This document builds on the original version of SEP 2.
The Project Members section, in particular, is heavily inspired by Voting Members in the Astropy project's [APE 0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst), but other sections also copy from it.
