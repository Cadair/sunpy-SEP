# Introduction
This SEP specifies the formal relationship between the SunPy project and
software packages affiliated with the SunPy project, but not directly managed
by it. These "Affiliated Packages" are registered with the SunPy
Project to benefit from the publicity and support available within the SunPy
community, while maintaining their independence and control over the package.
It is allowed, but not required or expected, that an affiliate package
(or part thereof) could be merged into the core SunPy library, following the
normal procedures, once it has matured.


# Detailed Description
As a community-driven project SunPy encourages contributions from a diverse
group of people on a wide range of software. Not all solar physics software
falls within the remit of the core SunPy library, and some software developers
may wish to maintain a degree of control over their software than it being part
of the core library would afford them.
Both of these reasons provide motivation for software which is associated with
SunPy but not contained within the core library. Having an association with
SunPy will provide advantages to these packages, such as the knowledge of the
SunPy community and the publicity provided by SunPy, while also allowing the
whole SunPy ecosystem to grow and provide useful tools to a larger audience.

## Requirements for Affiliated Packages

The SunPy project therefore maintains a list of "Affiliated Packages",
which is a software package that has registered with the SunPy board and been
accepted as an affiliated package. There are certain requirements for a package
to qualify as an affiliated package:

* The package must make use of all appropriate features in the core SunPy
  library, to reduce code duplication and complexity.
* The software must provide documentation that explains the function and use of
  the package, and this documentation should be of comparable standard to the
  core SunPy library.
* The code should as far as possible provide an easy to run test suite to
  verify the correct operation of the package.
* The developers of an affiliated package should engage with the rest of the
  SunPy community to encourage knowledge and code sharing within the community.
* The affiliated package should take all possible steps to not duplicate any
  functionality in either the core SunPy library or any other affiliated
  package.


## Acceptance Process for Affiliated Packages


A process for submission and review of affiliated packages will be written and
included in the SunPy core library documentation. This process should be clear,
fair and well documented and involve the lead developer or other people
nominated by the lead developer reviewing the submission against the criteria
above. It is expected that the review process would lead to a loose grading
against the various criteria.

The result of this review process would be a recommendation to accept or reject
the package as an affiliated package, which the lead developer would then pass
onto the board for a vote. The vote of the board to accept an affiliated package
would not have to follow the normal board voting procedure but could be
performed by a quorum of board members approving a pull request adding the
affiliated package to the official list of packages.


## SunPy Sponsored Affiliated Packages

An affiliated package will be deemed "sponsored" if it's development is overseen
by the SunPy board. This oversight would normally take the form of the package
being managed via the SunPy lead developer and the package being included in the
main SunPy GitHub organisation. It is expected that sponsored affiliated
packages would closely follow the development model of the core package, while
this is not required for non-sponsored packages.

This sponsored status means that the SunPy board has the responsibility of
continued maintenance for the package if the original maintainer(s) are no
longer available to perform the role. It is expected that the maintainers of
sponsored affiliated packages will be listed as part of the SunPy core team on
the website and be active members of the community.

Acceptance of a sponsored affiliated package will follow the same procedure as
all other affiliated packages with the decision between sponsored or not
sponsored being taken by the board in collaboration with the lead developer and
the maintainer(s) of the package.


## List of Affiliated Packages

A list of the affiliated packages will be kept in a publically avaliable location.
This list shall contain links to the source code, any website
associated with the package and contact details of the maintainer of the package.
There will be a list of packages maintained on the www.sunpy.org website,
which shall provide information to users about the affiliated packages.

## Packaging Affiliated Packages

To make it easier for developers to maintain affiliated packages a package
template will be provided. This will allow package maintainers to not have to
worry about Python packaging and documentation / testing infrastructure, and
concentrate on the development of their package.
This template will provide a package which is laid out and behaves much like
the core SunPy library.


# Decision Rationale
Accepted at the board meeting on 2014-10-17 by a vote of 8-0.
