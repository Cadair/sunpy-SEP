# Abstract
Using quantities with units is a great idea because it less likely that mistakes
will be made and units can be easily converted as needed. This SEP defines how physical
quantities should be dealt with in SunPy.

# Detailed Description
All function/object arguments which accept physical quantities as input must accept 
astropy quantities. In addition, arguments
must also accept a pure number whose expected unit must be clearly defined in the 
doc string of the function/object. Use of astropy quantities 
throughout code is also expected. This advice may be ignored if the use of quantities
would significantly impact performance. In this case the variable name must carry
the name of the unit (e.g. x_arcsec, length_meters). The same standards should be 
followed for functions whose output is a physical quantity.

## Usage Examples

### Simple Example

```python
def get_area_of_area(side_length):
    """Compute the area of a square.

    Parameters
    ----------
    side_length : `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
        Side length of the square
    
    Returns
    -------
    area : `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
        Area of the square in ``m^2``
    """
    if not isinstance(a, Quantity):
        raise TypeError("Expecting Quantity")
    
    return (side_length.convert('m')) ** 2
```

### Advanced Example

In this example, a function (`otherfunction`) is needed which does not play
well with quantities. In this case, the quantity is converted to a known unit and
is converted to a dimensional number. Afterwards the result (whose units should be known)
is then converted back to a quantity to be returned by the function.

```python
def somefunction(length):
    """Does something useful.

    Parameters
    ----------
    length : `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
        A length.
    
    Returns
    -------
    length : `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
        Another length in ``m``
    """
    if not isinstance(a, Quantity):
        raise TypeError("Expecting Quantity")
    
    length_meters = length.convert('meters').value
    # the following function either
    # a] does not accept Quantities
    # b] is slow if using Quantities
    result_meters = otherfunction(length_meters)
    
    # now convert back to a quantity
    result = Quantity(result_meters, 'meters')
    
    return result
```
