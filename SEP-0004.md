# Abstract
Using quantities with units is a great idea because it less likely that mistakes
will be made and units can be easily converted as needed. This SEP defines how physical
quantities should be dealt with in SunPy.

# Detailed Description
All function/object arguments must accept astropy quantities. In addition, arguments
must also accept a pure number whose expected unit must be clearly defined in the 
doc string of the function/object. Use of astropy quantities 
throughout code is also expected. This advice may be ignored if the use of quantities
would significantly impact performance. In this case the variable name must carry
the name of the unit (e.g. x_arcsec, length_meters). The same standards should be 
followed for functions whose output is a physical quantity.
