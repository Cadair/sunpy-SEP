## Abstract:
We all knew this day was coming, Lightcurve cannot escape the spotlight any
longer.
Lightcurve moves away from conditional dispatch to a Factory based creation
system so that it behaves like Map.
Also, all downloader functionality is extracted and added to a new net
submodule which provides a unified downloader for many sources.

## Reasoning:
This proposal makes an API change, which will move LightCurve to follow the API
of the Map submodule. This will provide end users a consistent interface
submodules and allow for cleaner and easier to read code for developers, much
like the map refactor did for the map submodule.
Also it will seperate the interests of the Lightcruve module, into the core
datatype and the data downloaders which belong in the net submodule.

## Relevant PRs:
* PR [#729](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/729) The update to the base
factory class, currently used for Map.
* PR [#896](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/896) The work in progress
implementation of this SEP.
* PR [#1088](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1088) The Unified Downloader PR.

# Implementation:

## Lightcurve Factory:
A factory instance (as proposed in #729) called LightCurve will be available in
the top level of the `sunpy.lightcurve` which will allow creation of all
registered LightCurve subclasses with the following API:

```Python
def LightCurve(filename=None, source=None, concatenate=True, *kwargs):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------------
    filename: string or File
        A file to read.
    source: string
        A string identifier for a registered subclass, matched by that
         subclasses `_is_source_for` method.
    concatenate :  boolean
        Concatenate all files into one Lightcurve object if True, or return
        one Lightcurve for each file if False.

    All other keywords are passed to _is_source_for and then __init__.
    """
```

This factory will be able to create lightcurves from one or multiple files,
with the multiple file behavior being determined by the `concatenate` flag.


### Examples:
* Create a LightCurve from a file, not-autodetected:
```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve(source='goes', filename.csv)
```

* Create a LightCurve from a file understood by sunpy.io:
```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve(filename.fits)
```

* URLs are handled just like files, they are downloaded to the data dir:
```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve(url)
>>> my_lc = LightCurve(url, url, source='goes', concatenate=True)
```

* Extra keyword arguments are passed to the `_is_source_for` and `__init__`
methods.
```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve('lyrafile.fits', source='lyra', date_events=[x,y,z])
```

* Multiple files can be combined into one LightCurve, as long as they are the
same source:
```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve([goesfile1.fits, goesfile2.fits], concatenate=True)
```

Which can then be cropped to a timerange:
```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve([myfile1.fits, myfile2.fits]).truncate(atimerange)
```

### LightCurve parsing order:

1. Filename:
    1. Attempt to read with `sunpy.io`: (Like `Map()`)
        1. Parse metadata to `_is_source_for` and find relevant subclass
        1. Create that LightCurve.
    1. Match ‘source’ flag to subclass and get subclass to read file:
        1. return data, meta pair, create instance.
    1. fail.
1. Daterange:
    1. Attempt read with `sunpy.io`, parse (data, meta) to subclass `__init__`.
    1. Attempt to read with subclass.
    1. fail
1. Other kwargs are processed and passed to subclass class method for returning
 `(data, meta)`.

### Required class methods:

1. parse specific data files that cannot be read by the `sunpy.io` module,
i.e. CSV or ASCII files.
1. Provide a `_is_source_for` which if possible auto detects the data type from
a (data, meta) pair, and also matches string names for the subclass
i.e. 'goes' or 'lyra', which will be passed into the factory to specify type
for download etc.

## Unified Downloader

The data acquisition functionality currently provided in Lightcurve will be
moved to a new generic downloader in `sunpy.net`. This framework will be
extensible and allow for future expansion of both Lightcurve and other data
sources.

This downloader will also follow a factory structure, where individual clients
can register with the downloader, and provide a method `_can_handle_query`
which describes which sets of attributes and values of those attributes that
client can provide data for.
The client uses the vso attribute mechanism to allow for complex queries which
can return results for multiple sources at once, including the VSO. The HEK is
not included in the downloader because it is a source of meta data so is best
handled independently.

#### Examples:

Downloading a LYRA file:

```python
>>> from sunpy.net import Downloader, attrs
>>> results = Downloader.query(attrs.Time("2012/1/1", "2012/1/2"),
                               attrs.Instrument('lyra'))
>>> print results
Start time  End time    Source  Instrument  URL                                                                                                         
----------  --------    ------  ----------  ---

>>> dl = Downloader.get(results)
>>> dl.wait(progress=True)
```

Downloading a LYRA file and a EVE file:

```python
>>> from sunpy.net import Downloader, attrs
>>> results = Downloader.query(attrs.Time("2012/1/1", "2012/1/2"),
                               attrs.Instrument('lyra') | attrs.Instrument('eve'))
>>> print results
Start time  End time    Source  Instrument  URL

```

Using VSO to service query
```python
>>> from sunpy.net.import Downloader,attrs
>>> results = Downloader.query(attrs.Time('2012/1/2 00:00:00','2012/1/2 00:10:00'), attrs.Instrument('AIA'), attrs.Wave(304, 304), attrs.Sample(60*10))
>>> results
[[(QueryResponseBlock)
{
   info = "AIA level 1, 4096x4096 [2.901 exposure] [100.00 percentd]"
   source = "SDO"
   provider = "JSOC"
   physobs = "intensity"
   fileid = "aia__lev1:304:1104537644"
   time = 
      (Time)
      {
	 end = "20120102000009"
	 start = "20120102000008"
      }
   instrument = "AIA"
   size = 66200.0
   wave = 
      (Wave)
      {
         waveunit = "Angstrom"
         wavemin = "304"
         wavetype = "NARROW"
         wavemax = "304"
      }
   extent = 
      (Extent){
          width = "4096"
          length = "4096"
          type = "FULLDISK"
   }
}}]]
>>> dl = Downloader.get(results)
>>> dl.wait()
['/home/rishabh/sunpy/data/aia_lev1_304a_2012_01_02t00_00_08_14z_image_lev1_fits']
```

once the download has completed you can pass the `Results` object instance into
the `Lightcurve` factory:

```python
>>> my_lc = sunpy.lightcurve.Lightcurve(dl)
```

This would only work where one source was downloaded, because the factory only
expects files for one source at a time.

It is expected that this downloader can be integrated into the database module
in the future, but that is not specified by this SEP, as it is a simple
substitution of the VSO module with this downloader.

### Query Responses and DownloadResponse Objects

The `query()` method of the `Downloader` instance returns a `QueryResponse`
object which contains all the results from all the clients that were queried to
execute the query. It also contains the client instances created to perform
the query, this enables the same instances to be used for download.
This object also provides some convenience functionality for the user to inspect
the results of a query before downloading the data. Methods to print out the
results (`__str__`) obtain the total number of results (`__len__`) and to
ascertain the time range of the returned data (`timerange`) are provided.

#### Examples:

```python
>>> len(results)
4
>>> print results
Start time  End time    Source  Instrument  URL                                                                                                         
----------  --------    ------  ----------  ---                                                                                                         
2012/01/01  2012/01/02  Proba2  lyra        http://proba2.oma.be/lyra/data/bsd/2012/01/01/lyra_20120101-000000_lev2_std.fits                            
2012/01/02  2012/01/03  Proba2  lyra        http://proba2.oma.be/lyra/data/bsd/2012/01/02/lyra_20120102-000000_lev2_std.fits                            
2012/01/01  2012/01/02  SDO     eve         http://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/data_access/evewebdata/quicklook/L0CS/SpWx/2012/20120101_EVE_L0CS_DIODES_1m.txt
2012/01/02  2012/01/03  SDO     eve         http://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/data_access/evewebdata/quicklook/L0CS/SpWx/2012/20120102_EVE_L0CS_DIODES_1m.txt

```

The `DownloadResponse` object is returned by the `get` method of the
`Downloader` class, this is a list of `Results` objects returned by each
client (which are the same as the VSO `Results` object).

### Hiearchy in attributes

Attributes ```Time, Instrument``` can be used with LightCurve, VSO, JSOC
(in future).As these attributes are no longer restricted to only VSO module,
they should be shifted outside VSO namespace.
```python
>>> from sunpy.net import Downloader, attrs
>>> results = Downloader.query(attrs.JSOC.series('hmi.m_45s'),attrs.Time('2012/2/2','2012/2/2'))
```
## Backwards Compatibility:
None, due to the current implementation of LightCurve it will be very hard to
maintain backwards compatibility.
It may be possible to implement a `.create()` method that calls the Factory,
however I would not recommend it.
