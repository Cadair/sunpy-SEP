# Abstract
Using quantities with units is a great idea because it less likely that mistakes
will be made and units can be easily converted as needed. This SEP defines how physical
quantities should be dealt with in SunPy.

# Detailed Description
All function/object arguments which accept physical quantities as input should accept 
astropy quantities. The same standards should be followed for functions whose output is a physical quantity, they should output an astropy quantity. For the sake of clarity and consistency, the output quantity must use [SI units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) and the unit should be documented in the doc string.

Use of astropy quantities throughout code is also expected. 

This advice may be ignored (but must be justified) if the use of quantities would significantly impact performance. In this case, functions/objects may accept quantity-free numbers (or output quantity-free numbers) but the variable name used for both input and output must carry the name of the unit (e.g. x_arcsec, length_meters) and the unit must be declared in the doc string.

## Usage Examples

### Simple Example

```python
def get_area_of_area(side_length):
    """Compute the area of a square.

    Parameters
    ----------
    side_length : `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
        Side length of the square
    
    Returns
    -------
    area : `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
        Area of the square in ``m^2``
    """
    if not isinstance(a, Quantity):
        raise TypeError("Expecting Quantity")
    
    return (side_length.convert('m')) ** 2
```

### Advanced Examples

In this example, a function (`otherfunction`) is needed which does not play
well with quantities. In this case, the quantity is converted to a known unit and
is converted to a dimensional number. Afterwards the result (whose units should be known)
is then converted back to a quantity to be returned by the function.

```python
def somefunction(length):
    """Does something useful.

    Parameters
    ----------
    length : `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
        A length.
    
    Returns
    -------
    length : `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
        Another length in ``m``
    """
    if not isinstance(a, Quantity):
        raise TypeError("Expecting Quantity")
    
    length_meters = length.convert('meters').value
    # the following function either
    # a] does not accept Quantities
    # b] is slow if using Quantities
    result_meters = otherfunction(length_meters)
    
    # now convert back to a quantity
    result = Quantity(result_meters, 'meters')
    
    return result
```

In the following example, the function is itself not quantity-friendly either because it is expected to deal with millions of quantities or for some other appropriate reason.

```python
def someotherfunction(many_lengths_meters):
    """Does something else useful.

    Parameters
    ----------
    many_lengths_meters : `numpy.ndarray`
        Lengths in ``m``.
    
    Returns
    -------
    other_length_meters : `numpy.ndarray`
        Lengths in ``m``
    """
    
    # do something with many_lengths_meters
    
    return result_meters
```
