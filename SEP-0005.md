## Abstract
This SEP describes the implementation of a new SunPy submodule
`sunpy.coordinates`. This submodule will provide objects to
represent spatial coordinates in all of the common solar physics
coordinate systems.
This submodule will utilize the Astropy coordinates submodule and
integrate heavily with that module.
This new submodule will replace most of the functionality currently
present in `sunpy.wcs`.

## Detailed Description
Astropy's new coordinates submodule (released as part of Astropy v0.4.0) 
provides a well designed and appropriate framework for implementing
solar physics coordinate transformations. The details of this
framework are described below.

The coordinates package is designed to provide transformations
between physical spatial coordinates, it does not provide the pixel
to world coordinate transformation framework. This is handled via
`astropy.wcs`.

### Definitions

The following provide some definitions used in this document with
regards to coordinates. These are based on the definitions in APE5.

1. **Coordinate Representation**: It is a particular way of describing 
    a unique point in a vector space (usually 3D space). Some examples of 
    significance to SunPy are the Cartesian and Cylindrical representations.

2. **Reference System**: It is a scheme used to orient points in a space. 
    It is used to describe how a point is transformed from system to system. 
    Examples from the Astropy codebase are the ICRS and equitorial coordinates
    (mean equinox) systems.

3. **Coordinate Frame**: This is a specific realization of a reference system.
    Some systems may have only one meaningful frame while yet others may have
    several different frames. A tentative example in the proposed SunPy 
    subpackage would be that of the helioprojective coordinates, with 
    Stonyhurst and Carrington realizations.


### The astropy.coordinates Sub-Package

The Astropy coordinate submodule has three sets of classes:

1. **Data Representation**: The representation of the data is the
   coordinates of the point in 3D space. The representation can be
   considered as the coordinate vector, for example, in Cartesian,
   Cylindrical or Spherical systems. These classes are generally not
   used by the user, apart from in advanced use cases. These
   representations hold their data in `Quantity` objects or
   subclasses.

2. **Low-Level Frames**: These classes are the objects that describe
   the coordinate system, origin, default representation *etc*.
   They also can hold the coordinate data (in a representation object), 
   however, a frame does not have to hold coordinate information and
   can just represent the reference system.

3. **High-Level Object**: The high level object is the
   `astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` object which provides the primary
   interface to both Astropy's coordinates submodule and SunPy's.
   This class can handle a wider variety of input and will sanitize
   this input and create a `CoordinateFrame` class.


### The Proposed sunpy.coordinates Sub-Package

The four primary coordinate systems, i.e., heliographic 
(Stonyhurst and Carrington), heliocentric and helioprojective
systems will be implemented. These will take the form of 
low-level frame classes - `HelioGraphicStonyhurst`, `HelioGraphicCarrington`, 
`HelioCentric` and `HelioProjective`. These will be made to subclass from 
`astropy.coordinates.BaseCoordinateFrame`.

To facilitate the convention of both helioprojective and
heliographic coordinate systems of wrapping Longitude at 180 &deg a
custom `SphericalWarp180Representation` object will be created as a
subclass of `astropy.coordinates.SphericalRepresentation` to set the
Longitude wrapping to 180 &deg.

No modification to or subclassing of `SkyCoord` will occur to
maintain maximum possible compatibility and interoperability with
Astropy and other packages which use its coordinates framework.

#### Basic Core API Examples

Creating a helioprojective `SkyCoord` object::


    import astropy.units as u
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    import sunpy.coordinates

    sc1 = SkyCoord(230*u.arcsec, 120*u.arcsec, frame='helioprojective')

Transforming this object to heliographic Stonyhurst:


    sc2 = sc1.transform_to('heliographicstonyhurst')

#### Helioprojective Coordinate Assumptions

Because the helioprojective coordinate system is a projective
system, where it is unusual to have information on the third spatial
dimension of a coordinate, some assumptions are normally made when
transforming from helioprojective to heliocentric coordinates.

This assumption (as currently implemented in `sunpy.wcs`) is that
during transformation, if no helioprojective radial coordinate was specified 
then the radial coordinate is calculated as if the coordinate point
is on the solar surface.

In the new coordinates submodule this assumption happens at
construction time of a `HelioProjective` frame. This means that all
`HelioProjective` frames are explicitly three dimensional.

The third coordinate can be specified explicitly upon construction:

    sc = SkyCoord(230*u.arcsec, 120*u.arcsec, 1*u.au, frame='helioprojective')

or will be calculated assuming your point is on the solar surface,
or be NaN.


#### Advanced API Examples


    from sunpy.coordinates.frames import HelioGraphicStonyhurst, HelioCentric
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    from astropy import units as u

    # Some ways to initialize a `SkyCoord` object.
    # In Heliographic Stonyhurst frames, one can declare so -:
    sc = SkyCoord(
        1*u.deg, 1*u.deg, 1*u.km, frame='heliographicstonyhurst', 
        dateobs='2011/01/01T00:00:45'
    )
    print(sc)
    # We can represent the data as another frame.
    print(sc.represent_as('heliocentric'))

    # One could also not give the distance/radius input, and it will
    # default to solar radius.
    sc = SkyCoord(
        1*u.deg, 1*u.deg, frame='heliographicstonyhurst', 
        dateobs='2011/01/01T00:00:45'
    )
    print(sc)

    # It is also possible to provide the representation-specific args as a 
    # `BaseRepresentation` object.
    from sunpy.coordinates.representation import SphericalWrap180Representation
    sc = SkyCoord(
        SphericalWrapRepresentation180(1*u.deg, 1*u.deg, 1*u.km), 
        frame='helioprojective', dateobs='2011/01/01T00:00:45'
    )
    print(sc)
    
    sc2 = None
    if sc.is_transformable_to('heliocentric'):
        sc2 = sc.transform_to('heliocentric') # Transforms to HelioCentric with Earth Equitorial as preferred rep.
